### Text Readability Fix - Hero Component
- **Fixed critical text readability issues** in Hero component
  - Removed problematic `gradient-text` class from "150+" counter that was making text unreadable
  - Increased background overlay opacity from `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4/0.6)` to `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7/0.8)` for better contrast
  - Applied consistent `text-white` color to all counter numbers for uniform readability
  - Added `drop-shadow-lg` to main headings and `drop-shadow-md` to supporting text
  - Changed trust indicator icons from `text-green-500` to `text-green-400` for better visibility
  - Added `justify-center` to trust indicators for better alignment
- **Enhanced global CSS** with improved text shadow utilities
  - Added `.text-shadow-sm`, `.text-shadow-md`, `.text-shadow-lg`, `.text-shadow-xl` classes
  - These provide consistent text shadow options for better readability on dark backgrounds
- **Improved overall visual hierarchy** and text contrast throughout the hero section
- **All text now clearly readable** against the dark background image

### Portfolio Content Expansion
- **Total featured projects increased** from 3 to 6

- **Consistent image handling** with local portfolio images

### Mobile Landscape Cards - FeaturesCarousel Component
- **Implemented smart mobile landscape detection** for optimal card display
  - Added `isMobileLandscape` state that detects when `width > height && width < 1024px`
  - Mobile Portrait: 1 card per slide (existing behavior)
  - Mobile Landscape: 2 cards per slide (new feature)
  - Desktop: 2 cards per slide (existing behavior)
- **Dynamic grid layout** that adapts to device orientation
  - Uses `isDesktop || isMobileLandscape ? 'grid-cols-2' : 'grid-cols-1'`

### Smart Navbar with Auto-Hide - Navbar Component
- **Implemented smart navbar behavior** for better mobile experience

  - **Show on scroll up:** Navbar slides down and reappears when scrolling up
  - **Always visible at top:** Navbar remains visible when near the top (≤ 100px)
- **Smooth animations** with 300ms ease-in-out transitions
  - Uses CSS transform: `translate-y-0` (visible) vs `-translate-y-full` (hidden)
  - Scroll direction detection with `window.scrollY` monitoring
  - Smart logic that prevents unnecessary hiding/showing

### Arrow-to-Card Spacing - FeaturesCarousel Component
- **Enhanced navigation arrow positioning** for better visual balance

  - **Tablet & Desktop (≥ 640px):** Shows full numbered pagination (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
  - **Clean mobile experience:** No more cramped numbered buttons on small screens
- **Responsive breakpoint logic** using `sm:` (640px) breakpoint
  - Hidden numbered pagination: `hidden sm:flex`
  - Mobile page indicator: `sm:hidden`
